# ICP

## Installation

The major issue is to well prepare the target environment. 

The [product doc](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_3.1.2/installing/install_containers.html) for installation. 

Our team installation [notes](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-privatecloud/)

Uninstall: It looks easy see [product doc](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_3.1.2/installing/uninstall.html)

## Adding worker node

[ICP doc on adding node](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBS6K_3.2.0/installing/add_node.html#host_group)

- copy one of the worker node VM, then stop the original one. Start the newly copied one, to change hostname with `sudo vi /etc/hostname` and change ip address: `sudo vi /etc/netplan/onofthe.yml` file.

Then on the master, modify the /etc/hosts with ip and hostname mapping. And run the ICP installer:

```
docker run -e LICENSE=accept --net=host -v "$(pwd)":/installer/cluster ibmcom/icp-inception-amd64:3.1.2-ee worker -l 172.16.52.44
```


## Troubleshooting

[Troubleshooting network issues for IBM Cloud Private on OpenStack](https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/troubleshooting-network-issues-for-ibm-cloud-private-icp-on-openstack/)


# IBM Cloud Developer Tools CLI

[IBM CLI](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cli) is a unified way to interact with your applications, containers, infrastructures, and other services. 

* Create an app: `ibmcloud dev create`
* Update an existing application with the goodies to deploy to the cloud: `ibmcloud dev enable`
* Create a git repo, and then push the code:
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/jbcodeforce/springkafka.git
git add .
git commit -m "First commit"
git push -u origin master
```
* Create a toolchain:  https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/setup/

# IKS



## Recommendations

* [Deep dive on IKS from Lionel Mace](https://ibm.ent.box.com/v/cloudiksenablement)

IKS cluster creation:
* multizone is for availability. It processes a VLAN lookup to reuse private and public
* 1.11.x uses the [containerd](https://containerd.io/) container engine.

# Multicloud management

Get visibility, governance, of container platforms or public or private clusters. It helps deploy app to clusters, and it is policy-based governance. Companies are using multiple private k8s clusters and public cluster on different cloud vendors. 

# Virtual Private Cloud
VPC delivers networking functions for cloud deployments in logically isolated segments using Software Defined Networking.

It is a virtual networking platform tied to a tenant account. It provides logical isolation within the same tenant and other tenants. 
Zones are created using high bandwidth and low latency connections (3 ms). 
A VPC spans multiple zones at each region for high availability. It does not span regions. With VPC, operators can customize network topologies, sizes, IP addressing without NAT or tunnels. It supports your own IP. The security controls are done at the subnet and server level.  
Some features:
* a region has three or more zones. 
* Multi zone regions is designed to support enterprise workloads accross application, data, security and solution domains.
* Availability zone is an independent fault domains that do not share physical infrastructure. It has a latency requirement of <500 micro second intra-zone and <2 ms inter-zone.
