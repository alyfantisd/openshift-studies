# Security

## Role Based Access Control

Add a user to a role:

```
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user strimzi-cluster-operator-namespaced IAM#emailasuserid@something.com
```

## Security Context Constraints

* Security Context Constraints (SCCs) to control permissions a pod can perform and what resources it can access
* Access to existing SCC: `kubectl get scc`
* Get security policies for a scc: `oc describe  scc privileged`
* You can specify SCCs as resources that are handled by RBAC. This allows you to scope access to your SCCs to a certain project or to the entire cluster. Assigning users, groups, or service accounts directly to an SCC retains cluster-wide scope
