# Deployments examples

## Deploy nodejs app using appsody

## Deploy zipkin from docker image

Install it, and expose it with a service

```
oc new-app --docker-image=openzipkin/zipkin

oc expose svc/zipkin
```
A new route is created visible with `oc get routes`. Once the hostname is added to a DNS or /etc/hosts. 

See zipkin architecture [article here](https://zipkin.io/pages/architecture.html)

## Deploy sparks

[Using the operator, see this note](spark-on-os.md)

## Mongodb

Define an env file with the following variables:
MONGODB_USER=mongo
MONGODB_PASSWORD=mongo
MONGODB_DATABASE=reeferdb
MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password

then run:

```
oc new-app --env-file=mongo.env --docker-image=openshift/mongodb-24-centos7
```

See the service:

```
oc describe svc mongodb-24-centos7
```

For more detail see [this note](https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/using_images/db_images/mongodb.html)

## Deploy Jupyter lab

See [this note](https://blog.openshift.com/jupyter-openshift-part-2-using-jupyter-project-images/) to deploy Jupyter lab lastest image to Openshift using the Deploy Image choice. The deployment is done under the project `reefer-shipment-solution`

The environment variable needs to be set to get Jupyter lab.

It takes multiple minutes to deploy. For the permission error due to the jovyan user not known, the command was:

```
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default -n reefer-shipment-solution
```

```
 oc get routes
NAME  HOST/PORT   PATH      SERVICES                PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
jupyterlab              jupyterlab-reefer-shipment-solution.greencluster-fa9ee67c9ab6a7791435450358e564cc-0001.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud    all-spark-notebook   8888-tcp      None
```

Get the secuity token to login in via the pod logs.

```
oc get pods 
NAME                             READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
all-spark-notebook-2-z4dqx  
```

```
oc logs all-spark-notebook-2-z4dqx 
```

To avoid loosing the work on the notebook, we need to add PVC to `/home/jovyan/work` mount point

```
oc get dc

oc set volume dc/all-spark-notebook  --add --mount-path /home/jovyan/work --claim-size=1G
```
