## Container technology

difference between container applications and traditional deployments

* The major drawback to traditionally deployed software application is that the application's dependencies are entangled with the runtime environment
* a traditionally deployed application must be stopped before updating the associated dependencies
        * complex systems to provide high availability 
* A container is a set of one or more processes that are isolated from the rest of the system. 
        * security, storage, and network isolation
        * isolate dependent libraries and run time resources
        * less resources than VM, start quickly.
        * helps with the efficiency, elasticity, and reusability of the hosted applications, and portability
        * [Open Container initiave](https://www.opencontainers.org/)
* Container image: bundle of files and metadata
* Container engine: Rocket, Drawbridge, LXC, Docker, and Podman

* Started in 2001 with VServer, then move to isolated process which leverage the linux features:
        * **Namespaces**: The kernel can isolate specific system resources, usually visible to all processes, by placing the resources within a namespace. Namespaces can include resources like network interfaces, the process ID list, mount points, IPC resources, and the system's host name information.
        * **cgroups**: Control groups partition sets of processes and their children into groups to manage and limit the resources they consume.
        * **Seccomp** defines a security profile for processes, whitelisting the system calls, parameters and file descriptors they are allowed to use
        * SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) is a mandatory access control system for processes. Protect processes from each other and to protect the host system from its running processes

## Openshift

RHOCP adds the capabilities to provide a production PaaS platform such as remote management, multitenancy, increased security, monitoring and auditing, application life-cycle management, and self-service interfaces for developers.
